# Analysing-the-Nobel-Prize-with-Plotly-Matplotlib-Seaborn
In this project, I analysis a dataset on the past winners of the Nobel Prize. I create a Choropleth to display data on a map and bar charts showing different segments of the data with Plotly. Also I can see the distribution of our data and visualise descriptive statistics with the help of a histogram in Seaborn.
